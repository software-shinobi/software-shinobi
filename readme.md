## How I Help As A Developer

As a developer, I do many things. Wear many hats.

It's a shared reality of existence as a software developer.

Software Developer Developer C'est La Vie.

Somebody coin that.

If i tried to boil down what I do as a software developer into something short, I'd say something like the following:

- [ ] Rapid Software Prototyping
- [ ] UI and Backend Software Development
- [ ] Cloud Computing and Hybrid IT
- [ ] Agile Transformation and DevOps

## About Me // Software Shinobi

In this section, I attempt to boil down over 15+ years of professional software development experience.

I've supported missions and initiatives in the private sector, the public sector, contracting, consulting, freelancing.

Whatever all of that means.

```
Editorâ€™s Note:

I totally love the idea of "Developer Of Fortune".

But like "Soldiers Of Fortune", but iâ€™m like a contract killer but i'm not a killer.

I'm just a developer.

And I likeâ€¦ save the day with my keyboard and the terminal from 3rd world countries.

Like Jack Bauer in the south american jungle or something.

Somebody get Steven Spielberg on the phone.

```

Anywaysâ€¦

Hereâ€™s my LinkedIn.

Over on LinkedIn I go into more detail around my corporate experiences and stuff like that.

## My Tool Stack / What I Use

The *very first* lesson in software developer school is blame the tools and the stack and the dev environment.

Blame everything on that. Everything. 

And when that doesn't work, blame the database team. When that doesn't work, blame the network team.

The *final* lesson of developer school is to not ever talk about developer school.

I think there were threats of public stoning or something like that. i don't remember.

So before I can blame everything on the tools and the stack and the dev environments...

I'll first need to share my own tools and stacks and stuff.

## Check Out My Stuff

I once thumbed through a book that suggested in order to receive, we must share.

So let's do that.

When you've got a sec, browse through my AllMyLinks page at the link below.

On my AllMyLinks page I've shared things about me and what I've done and what I've created.

I like to think of it as sharing my Magick with the Universe.
