## What I Do / How I Help

As a developer, I do many things.

It's a simple reality of our existence as life as a dev. [Whatever that means].

But if i tried to boil down what I do into something short, I'd say something like the following:

- [ ] Rapid Software Prototyping
- [ ] Agile Transformation and DevOps
- [ ] UI and Backend Software Development
- [ ] Cloud Computing and Hybrid IT
