## How I Help As A Developer

As a developer, I do many things. 

Wear many hats.

It's a simple reality of our existence as life as a dev. [Whatever that means].

Software Developer Developer C'est La Vie.

Somebody coin that.

If i tried to boil down what I do as a software developer into something short, I'd say something like the following:

- [ ] Rapid Software Prototyping
- [ ] UI and Backend Software Development
- [ ] Cloud Computing and Hybrid IT
- [ ] Agile Transformation and DevOps

## About Me // Software Shinobi

In this section, I attempt to boil down over 15+ years of professional software development experience.

I've supported missions and initiatives in the private sector, the public sector, contracting, consulting, freelancing.

Whatever all of that means.

```
**Editorâ€™s Note:**

 I totally love the idea of "Developer Of Fortune".

But like "Soldiers Of Fortune", but iâ€™m like a contract killer but i'm not a killer.

And I likeâ€¦ save the day with my keyboard and the terminal from3rd world countries.

Like Jack Bauer or something.

Somebody get Steven Spielberg on the phone.

```

Anywaysâ€¦

Hereâ€™s my LinkedIn.

Over on LinkedIn I go into more detail around my corporate experiences and stuff like that.
